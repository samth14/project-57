            <h2>Here is a mini-biography on him.</h2>
            <p>The Weeknd, originally Abel Tesfaye, broke into the music scene with the 2011 mixtape House
                 of Balloons. He went on to work with Drake, Wiz Khalifa and others, while building his own 
                 career as an artist. In 2015, the Weeknd enjoyed huge success with the Grammy-winning 
                 album Beauty Behind the Madness, which boasted the hit single “Can’t Feel My Face.” His 
                 follow-up album, Starboy (2016), also won a Grammy and featured collaborations with
                artists such as Daft Punk.Born Abel Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada,
                 the Weeknd has become one of the music industry's leading alternative R&B performers.
                  He is the son of Ethiopian immigrants but has had little contact with his father, who 
                  left the family when the Weeknd was only a toddler. His early musical influences ranged 
                  from traditional Ethiopian music to the "King of Pop," Michael Jackson. In an interview
                   with Vanity Fair, the Weeknd specifically cited the impact of Jackson’s 1979 hit "Don’t
                    Stop ‘til You Get Enough," describing it as "the song that helped me find my voice. 
                    It’s the reason I sing.” Never shy about displaying his vocal talents, the Weeknd 
                    started recording his efforts while in high school. After dropping out, he continued
                     exploring his interest in music, and released a free download called House of Balloons
                      in 2011. This, along with two more mixtapes, helped push his career forward.
                       He worked with Drake on his 2011 album, Take Care, which featured several tracks 
                       from House of Balloons, and landed a deal with Universal’s Republic Records.The 
                       Weeknd’s earlier mixtapes were re-released as 2012’s Trilogy, which became a
                        platinum-selling record for the young artist. Despite his growing popularity, 
                        he managed to hide himself from the public at large. The Weeknd refused interviews
                         for a long time and chose to use images of women for his 2013 album, Kiss Land, 
                         rather than pictures of himself. Some of the mystique he built around himself was 
                         intentional, but it also reflected the shyness and insecurities that troubled him
                          early in his career. In addition to his own work, the Weeknd collaborated with 
                          other artists. He appeared on Wiz Khalifa’s “Remember You” in 2012 and worked 
                          with Rick Ross on his 2014 album, Mastermind. That same year, the Weeknd helped
                           producer Max Martin with Ariana Grande’s hit “Love Me Harder,” and also scored 
                           success with “Earned It,” the first single released from the Fifty Shades of
                            Grey soundtrack. In 2015, the Weeknd continued his rise to the top with the 
                            No. 1 album Beauty Behind the Madness. His disco-pop infused single “Can’t
                             Feel My Face,” which could be about a romantic experience or drug use, became
                              for many the unofficial song of the summer, while his ballad “The Hills” also
                               made quite an impression on music fans. This well-received record helped the
                                Weeknd rack up an impressive seven nominations for the 2016 Grammy Awards,
                                 winning for Best R&B Performance for "Earned It" and Best Urban 
                                 Contemporary Album. He also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original 
                                 Song, also for "Earned It." In late November 2016, the Weeknd released his
                         third album, Starboy. Along with guest appearances by Lana Del Rey, Future and Kendrick Lamar, the 
                         studio effort prominently featured French electronic duo Daft Punk, who collaborated on the 
                         chart-topping title track and its follow-up single, "I Feel It Coming." 
                         The following year, the Weeknd reciprocated some of the guest contributions by
                          appearing on albums for Del Rey and Future. He then took home the Best Urban 
                        Contemporary Album Grammy for Starboy in early 2018.In late March 2018, the Weeknd
                         dropped My Dear Melancholy. Featuring the single "Call Out My Name," the EP marked
                          a return to the darker, gloomier sound that permeated the artist's earlier music.
                           Shortly after the EP's release, the Weeknd headlined the two-weekend Coachella
                        Valley Music and Arts Festival, along with Beyoncé and Eminem.The Weeknd returned 
                        to the spotlight in 2019 by making his feature film debut in the Adam Sandler 
                        flick "Uncut Gems." Later that year he was back to making headlines with his 
                        music, dropping the singles "Heartless" — which became his fourth track to top 
                        the Billboard Hot 100 — and "Blinding Lights," ahead of the March 2020 release 
                        of the album After Hours. In November 2020 it was announced that the Weeknd would
                         perform at the 2021 Super Bowl In Tampa, Florida.
